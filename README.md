## Project Summary

This project analyzes the performance of marketing campaigns and provides insights to optimize advertising budgets. It evaluates the effectiveness of campaigns across multiple channels, platforms, locations, devices, and campaign goals, identifying key drivers of higher conversions and improved cost efficiency.
The analysis provides an interactive dashboard that shows key metrics, including impressions, clicks, spend, conversions, ROAS, CPC, and conversion rates. This helps stakeholders monitor campaign trends over time, evaluate overall effectiveness, and make informed, data-driven decisions to improve future marketing strategies.

## About the Dataset

Source: Kaggle – Marketing Campaign Analysis Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajusaipainkra/marketing-campaign-analysis-dataset
This dataset captures daily marketing campaign performance across cities, with details on campaign, date, location, channel, device, and ad type. It includes key metrics like impressions, clicks, CTR, CPC, spend, conversions, conversion value, and social engagement (likes, shares, comments). It contains 9,900 rows and 18 columns.

## Analytical Questions

1. Which campaign (Summer, Spring, Fall) achieved the highest ROAS and conversion rate? Which campaign had the highest spend but low effectiveness?

2. Are there seasonal or time-based trends in campaign performance from March to October?

3. Which advertising channels (Pinterest, Instagram, Facebook) and cities (London, Manchester, Birmingham) delivered the most cost-effective conversions?

4. How does the conversion rate vary by device (Mobile vs. Desktop), channel, and ad type?

5. Which ad types (Discount vs. Collection) contribute most to return on ad spend (ROAS) while maintaining low cost per conversion?

## Key Actionable Insights

The following are key actionable insights derived from the dashboard analysis:
The Summer campaign delivered the highest ROAS (14.09) and ranked second in conversion rate (0.89%), making it the most effective seasonal strategy to prioritize in future campaigns. ROAS started rising in June (14.08), peaked in July (14.43), and remained high in August (13.75), highlighting a clear seasonal trend. Allocating more budget during these months could maximize profit and reach.

Among channels, Pinterest stood out as the most cost-effective, achieving the highest ROAS (22.47) and lowest cost per conversion (£2.45). Meanwhile, Birmingham was the most efficient city, with a cost per conversion of only £3.09.

The Discount ad type delivered better ROAS (11.79 vs. 9.11), but with higher cost per conversion (£4.30 vs. £3.78), which suggests it could be optimized for better efficiency.
